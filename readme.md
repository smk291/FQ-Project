# Whether

This web app, Whether, tells commuters/travelers what the weather is likely to be at various points on their trip. It uses google maps javascript and the forecast.io api.

It's unfinished. I still need to make markers informative and visually representative, and integrate openweathermaps' api for images fo radar and cloud cover and google charts for more attractive display of data.

###To do

1. Fix zoom/overlapping problems

1. Make main/menu div larger
1. Make main/menu div fade in or load more smoothly
1. Make menu div retractable

1. Add info to markers
